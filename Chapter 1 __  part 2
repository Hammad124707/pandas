Introduction : we usually don't work on dataframes altogether we divide them into series then work on series individually.
To work on series we first need to pull them out of DataFrame.



3 ways to select  a column from a dataframe.

df["column_name"]
df.column_name
df.loc[ : , "column_name"]       df.loc[ row information,column information ]


#Calling methods on columns
Jaise chapter1 part 1 mein hamne dekha ke sabse goat attribute he (.info() ) usi tariqe se idhr sabse mazeedar method he .value_counts()

1 or bht kaam ka method  he hamare pass .unique()
ye hamari series mein sara uniqe data batadega



another kaam ka method hamare pass joke he .count() ye hamien bataega ke hamare pass kitne non-missing values hein we can also apply this on our dataframe

.describe() ye wala method hamari dataframe ka poora poora statistics wala raaz khol deta he
we can also individually apply .min()  , .max() ,


ajeebsa method: .isna() yeh 1   series banaega jo sirf boolean hogi or isme sirf true false hoga, true for missing values and false for non missing values.

we can also use .any() method while working in pandas

.dropna() this will drop the complete dataframe however we can manipulate it to not do that by giving the argument , df.dropna(how = "all")  this will only drop that row which
has all the null values.


df.fillna() 1 dictionary bhi as an argument le sakti he jisme ham specify kardien ke konsa column kia input dega when it comes to filling missing values.

Its sugguested that missing values should be filled with mean median and mode.
